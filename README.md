Health Monitoring System

A compact and efficient IoT-based Health Monitoring System built using ESP32, DS18B20, HW‑827 Heart Rate Sensor, and DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor. The system provides real‑time health data monitoring and includes a custom-built UI for scheduling health checks from person to person.

🚀 Features

Real-time body temperature monitoring using DS18B20

Heart rate and pulse detection using HW‑827

Ambient temperature & humidity data using DHT11

Wi-Fi enabled data transmission using ESP32

Custom UI dashboard for:

Viewing live sensor data

Scheduling health check sessions

Managing multiple persons efficiently

🛠 Hardware Used

ESP32 Development Board

DS18B20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor

HW‑827 Pulse/Heart Rate Sensor

DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

Jumper wires & 4.7kΩ pull‑up resistor (for DS18B20)

📡 Software & Tools

Arduino IDE

Blynk / Custom dashboard

Custom UI for scheduling

📘 How It Works

Sensors collect body temperature, ambient temperature/humidity, and pulse rate.

ESP32 processes readings and sends them to the cloud/dashboard.

Users can monitor data in real time on the UI.

Scheduling module allows assigning time slots for each person.
